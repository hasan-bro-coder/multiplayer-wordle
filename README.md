# Wordle Multiplayer Game

Welcome to the **Wordle Multiplayer Game**! This is a browser-based multiplayer version of the popular word-guessing game, 
built with **Vite** for the frontend and **TypeScript** with **Socket.IO** for the backend. 
Players can join rooms, compete in real-time, and guess the hidden word together.

## How to Play
   1. **Create or Join a Room**:
        - Enter your name and either create a new room or join an existing one using a room code.
   2. **Guess the Word**:
        - You have 6 attempts to guess the hidden 5-letter word.
        - After each guess, the tiles will change color to indicate how close your guess was:
          - ðŸŸ© *Green*: Correct letter in the correct position.
          - ðŸŸ¨ *Yellow*: Correct letter in the wrong position.
          - â¬› *Gray*: Letter not in the word.

   3. **Win or Lose**:
        - If you guess the word correctly within 6 attempts, you win!
        - If you run out of attempts, the game ends, revealing the correct word.
